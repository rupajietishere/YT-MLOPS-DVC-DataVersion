1. Create a Git repo and create it in local.
2. Create code.py and code to it. It will save a .csv file to a new "data" folder.
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc. 
4. pip install dvc
5. Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
6. Now do "mkdir S3" (Creates a new S3 directory)
7. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
8. Next "dvc add data/"
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
9. Again do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
10. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push". 
11. Now we make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
12. Again - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
